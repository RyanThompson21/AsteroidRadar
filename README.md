The app records asteroid data (velocity, magnitude, etc.) from NASA's NeoWs api, stores it locally in a Room database, and displays it in a sorted list, along side NASA's picture of the day
The api key is in the Constants.kt folder and will eventually expire. You can get a new one using this link: https://api.nasa.gov/
